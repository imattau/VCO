# Brainstorming Workflow

The goal of brainstorming is to explore requirements, identify multiple possible solutions, and surface risks or constraints before committing to a plan.

## Principles
1. **Quantity over Quality**: Generate at least 3 distinct approaches for complex tasks.
2. **Surface Assumptions**: Explicitly list what you are assuming to be true.
3. **Identify Risks**: Note potential technical hurdles, security concerns, or architectural misalignments.
4. **Solicit Feedback**: Present options to the user with pros/cons for each.

## Checklist
- [ ] Define the core problem statement.
- [ ] List at least three alternative approaches (if applicable).
- [ ] Detail the pros/cons for each approach.
- [ ] Identify dependencies (libraries, existing code).
- [ ] Flag potential "gotchas" (edge cases, performance).
